Distantly Comes a Dream

She is a brave, empty orphan.
Her eyebrow space was in the head of her heart, and the most bees were usefully, and passionately, a red race.
It burnt through the destructive side of cancer wind.
The knife of bees which sliced through words.
With drain throughput, it loved meaning, and wanted to mutually embrace.

Stepping through dazzling lights,
My sharp feet step into ten thousand cows.
The tide of sound from the tide of people flips and comes through.
The whole empty establishment is also shyly bowing,
Thanking the sight of forever strong bees.

She spreads her arms;
Hugging the broken burning, hugging life.
She went to exchange a bunch of light traffic stops.
Her whole face was unintelligent like writing paper.
The scenery of her wrong shoulder...
Irrigation; but first, it was up to spectators to criticize it.

The sunshine molests her raven hair...
The sound of wind refurbishes her steps.
Right then, the deity kissed her face
And beside her lips she laughed, then did her grey armour.
